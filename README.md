# Smart-Teaching
This project aims to promote the online teaching culture started after the covid-19 scene and gives a suitable platform to local teachers to go their classes from offline to online. This android app will have all the necessary features required for classes like notes download, meeting links, even fee payment if possible and also for test-taking in a simpler manner than other apps.
